<h1>What is Basis?</h1>

<p>
Basis is an <a href="https://gitlab.com/basisproject/">open-source</a> set of tools that facilitate the economic operations of a socialist economy. It is based on the ideas behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_association_(Marxism_and_anarchism)">free association of producers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation_in_kind">in-kind cost tracking</a>:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A public market where companies and consumers can order products and services from each other</li>
	<li>Cost tracking that determines the labor and resources (for example fossil fuels) that go into every product and service</li>
	<li>Asset management for determining the use of publicly-owned assets (housing, factories, heavy machinery, etc)</li>
	<li>Banking that facilitates interfacing with the outside market system</li>
	<li>Voting tools that promote self-determination of members</li>
	<li>A system for defining and operating public companies and projects (such as hospitals, pharmaceutical research, space exploration, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The goal of Basis is not to provide a societal blueprint, but rather provide tools that empower people to build their own society around production based on need instead of profit. The project uses the concept of "regions" which act as federated geographical containers, allowing the people of a particular area decide for themselves how their region should operate.</a>

<h1>Why build this?</h1>

<p>
As capitalism has given to us, it has also taken away. It gives us a wage but takes our sense of ownership and purpose. It gives us houses but forces us into debt to live in them. It gives us hospitals but bankrupts us when we use them. It takes our political self-determination and replaces it with an endless stream of consumer trinkets, all while telling us it's giving us "choice."
</p>

<p>
The goal of Basis is to enable a system where we keep our sense of ownership and purpose, we keep the houses and hospitals we have built, we keep our self-determination, but shed the perversion of capital and the alienation it brings with it.
</p>

<p>
Imagine a world where instead of asking "Will this make money?" people ask "Will this be useful to others?" It's a small shift in thinking, but would profoundly change our relationships to production, the environment, and each other. What would the world look like if we felt a connection to not just the things we made, but with the meaning behind our work? Basis was built with the goal of enabling an economy where profit is removed from production, replacing the random coldness of markets with a sense of connected purpose.
