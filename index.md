# What is Basis?

At its core, Basis is a cost-tracking product network. Companies use it to track labor time, order products and services from other companies, and to provide their own products and services to others. It tallies a company's labor costs and outgoing orders and uses them to assign costs to each of the company's products and services.

Basis also allows tagging certain products as "resources" which are then tracked separately along with the labor time required to build things. The end result is that for every product available in the system, anybody can see not just how much labor went into building the product, but exact amounts of other resources as well (such as fossil fuels or scarce resources).

The goal of Basis is to enable an economy in which direct costs are known, in disaggregate, as opposed to a money-based system where all costs are bundled into one meaningless number. In other words, a chair no longer costs $30, but rather 3 hours of labor time, 5kg lumber, 150g iron, and 300ml diesel fuel. This has large implications for measuring not just resource usage, but also costs of various externalities such as carbon output.

Think of Basis as a moneyless Amazon that tracks costs of production directly.

# Why build this?

As capitalism has given to us, it has also taken away. It takes our sense of ownership and mastery and gives us a wage. It gives us houses but forces us into debt to live in them. It gives us hospitals but bankrupts us when we use them. It takes our political self-determination and replaces it with an endless stream of consumer trinkets, all while telling us it's giving us "choice."

The goal of Basis is to enable a system where we keep our sense of ownership and mastery, we keep the houses and hospitals we have built, we keep our self-determination, but shed the perversion of capital and the alienation it brings with it.

Imagine a world where instead of asking "Will this make money?" people ask "Will this be useful to others?" It's a small shift in thinking, but would profoundly change our relationships to production, the environment, and each other. What would the world look like if we felt a connection to not just the things we made, but with the meaning behind our work? Basis was built with the goal of enabling an economy where profit is removed from production, replacing the random coldness of markets with a sense of connected purpose.

# How would it work?

Companies using Basis would not buy or sell things, but would rather create orders, and the company they order from would fill it. It's that simple. Demand is measured not by price, but rather simply by the number of incoming orders. Because costs are derived as a function of inputs and outputs, pricing isn't needed.

This new relationship distributes the power of banks or central planners to other producers. If you need a machine to make something, instead of taking out a loan and buying it, you share your plan with the producer of the machine and they can decide whether or not to build one for you.

This shouldn't be confused with everything being "free" however. Because things have costs associated with them, the costs move through the economy until they are consumed. The simplest way to handle this is for workers to get credits for their labor, which they can then spend on goods produced by the Basis economy. The cost of the product would be the cost of the labor it took to build it (and credits would be destroyed when the product is bought). Another method might be to give out resource credits to workers, which would transform an economy from labor-based to resource-based, putting downward pressure on resource usage as opposed to labor time.

Even without money circulating the primary economy, there are a number of ways to lower costs and limit overconsumption.
