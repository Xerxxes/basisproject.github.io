# What is Basis?

At its core, Basis is a product network and cost tracker. Companies use it to track labor time, order products and services from other companies, and to provide their own products and services to others. It tallies a company's labor costs and outgoing orders and uses them to assign costs to each of the company's products and services.

Basis also allows tagging certain products as "resources" which are then tracked separately along with the labor time required to build things. The end result is that for every product available in the system, anybody can see not just how much labor went into building the product, but exact amounts of other resources as well (such as fossil fuels or scarce resources).

The goal of Basis is to enable an economy in which direct costs are known, in disaggregate, as opposed to a money-based system where all costs are bundled into one meaningless number. In other words, a chair no longer costs $30, but rather 3 hours of labor time, 5kg lumber, 150g iron, and 300ml diesel fuel.

Think of Basis as a moneyless Amazon that tracks costs of production directly.

# Why build this?

Imagine a world where instead of asking "Will this make money?" people ask "Will this be useful to others?" It's a small shift in thinking, but would profoundly change our relationships to production, the environment, and each other. What would the world look like if we measured our daily activities not by how much they benefited ourselves, but rather how much they benefited others? Basis was built with the goal of enabling an economy where profit is removed from production. The idea is that once profit is no longer the primary driver, what's left is building things for use.

With Basis, economic demand is measured simply by incoming orders, and then supply would be built to match it. Because costs are derived as a function of inputs and outputs, pricing isn't needed.
